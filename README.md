# Pre-work - *Tip*

**Tip** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Evelyn Hasama**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [ ] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] UI Image View of a heart
- [ ] Clear button that resets everything to 0
- [ ] Default tip percentages on Settings Page
- [ ] Default background colors on Settings Page
- [ ] Label with a cute tip-related message
- [ ] App Icon
- [ ] "Tap Here" text inside the Bill Field

## Notes

The most difficult challenges presented themselves when adding additional features to the Tip Calculating app. Without the instructional video to guide me, I made several errors, especially in creating the Default Tip feauture and the Default Color feauture. While I did spend some time constructing the necessary feautures of the app, most of my hours were devoted to enhancing the app to make it more aesthetically pleasing and personalizable. Upon putting my repository on GitHub, I did have challenges uploading my work from XCode's Source Control center, as demonstrated in the video. However, I was able to upload my files through another method that should work as well.
